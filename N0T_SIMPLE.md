Maximilus — once the most wanted hacker in his world, now the only thing standing between humanity and total annihilation — faces a terrifying cyborg.
The cyborg’s crimson optics glow like twin dying suns. Its voice is cold, synthetic, final. “ORGANIC THREAT DETECTED. COMMENCING TERMINATION PROTOCOL.” Maximilus backs away slowly, hands raised. He’s out of ammo, out of allies, out of time. But he’s not out of tricks. During the infiltration he glimpsed something — a fragment of source code etched on a shattered server panel, half-buried under sparking cables. An emergency override sequence meant for developers only. He’d memorized it in the chaos… or so he thought. Heart pounding, he shouts the phrase into the dark.
The cyborg pauses. For a split second, hope flares. Then its head tilts, almost mockingly.“OVERRIDE DENIED. AUTHENTICATION FAILURE." The real eight-character override is in there. Hidden. Waiting.
If he can recover it, the cyborg drops.
If he fails… well… there won’t be anyone left to write the after-action report.
This is it, legend.
The Citadels's last hope.
One shard.
One chance.
Find the true override command.
